# React Router Dom v6 Path Matching Bug

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in React Router Dom v6 related to path matching.  Under specific circumstances, routes defined using `path="/about"` (or similar) may fail to match when navigating directly to that path. This often happens after a page refresh or when deploying to a production server.

The bug appears to be intermittent and might be related to how the router handles the initial render and client-side navigation.  The solution involves ensuring the base path is correctly configured and handled, as detailed in `bugSolution.js`.
